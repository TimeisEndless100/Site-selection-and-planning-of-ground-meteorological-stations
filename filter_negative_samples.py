"""
Description:
    Filters remote-sensing patch files by their average slope value, retaining only those
    with mean slope greater than a specified threshold (25 degrees) and exports the filtered
    metadata to a new CSV.

Inputs:
    - patches--64/patches_info.csv :
        CSV file listing patch filenames and associated metadata.
    - patches--64/<filename>      :
        Directory containing GeoTIFF patches with three bands: [landcover, slope, elevation].

Outputs:
    - patches--64/patches_info_slope_gt25.csv :
        CSV containing only those records whose slope band average > 25.

Parameters:
    - patch_dir    : str  - Directory containing patch files and metadata CSV
    - threshold    : float - Slope threshold in degrees (default = 25)
